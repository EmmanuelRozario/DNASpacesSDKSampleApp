# TEST PLAN USING NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE AND DEVICES

## Introduction

Open Roaming is an initiative to bring together several different companies in a federation, in order to facilitate the connection of users on networks.

## Objective

This document presents a plan for testing the Open Roaming 2.0 sample application, in addition to testing on networks. It is divided in four main sections: Environments, Test cases, Cycles and Results.

The Environments section presents all devices which will be used on the tests, showing also a brief description of how each of them have to be configured so the tests can proceed successfully. The tests will involve:

* 1 Samsung S10;
* 1 Motorola G6 Plus;
* 1 iPhone 7;
* 1 iPhone 11;
* 1 Google Pixel 3a;
* 1 Cisco Catalyst 9115 Series AP.

Next, there is the Test Cases section. This section presents a table containing each of the individual tests that compose the Test Cycles (which will be explained later) and it is divided in five columns, which are:

* Test case: The name of the test case, which gives a brief introduction of what the test is about;
* Preparation: Shows the pre-requisites so this test case can be executed;
* Execution: The steps to execute this test case;
* Accept: What is expected as a result so this test case can be considered as accepted;
* Image: This column is for adding the expected results evidences in form of images.

Some scenarios are not being displayed here in form of screenshots because of lack of data. If you wish to see a simulation of all screens with data displayed, please access our Wireframe sample application page clicking [here](https://fit-tecnologia.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CIS/pages/865599948/Sample+Application+Wireframe+-+V2).

Below, there is the Test Cycles section, which also presents a table, but this time containing the Test Cycles that will be executed. Each test cycle is made of a group of test cases that must be executed to perform an expected behavior. For example, the Test Cycle #1:

| **Cycle** | **Tests** |
| #1 Cycle - Successful Login/Register with Google | #1 Open Application#2 Register - Authentication with Google#3 Register - Successful authentication with Google |

In this cycle, the tests #1, #2 and #3 must be executed to perform a Successful Login/Register with Google.

And finally, the Results section. This section presents a table that contains four columns, which are:

* Name: The name of the test cycle that was executed to achieve this result;
* Environment: The environment where this test cycle was executed, which can be Samsung S10, Motorola G6 Plus, iPhone 7 or iPhone 11;
* Status: The status of the respective test cycle, for example "Not tested" or "Completed";
* Result: This column is for describing the actual result of the test cycle in a real device.

In the Results section, each Test Cycle will be executed in all environments informed in this document.
